# table-that-is-fetching-data-from-api-
Hi I have made this web app that fetch data from api and load it to table just open command of windows and type json-server --watch api.json
your api will be running on http://localhost:3000/StartUps and then open new command and type nodemon server.js then open http://localhost:8000/
